# daily-planner-app
Daily planner built using HTML5 local storage feature

This Daily Planner App Project was completed as part of a Udemy course on HTML5 programming by Brad Traversy & Leslie Zavarellla.

It uses Bootstrap 3.3.7 and uses JavaScript and JQuery to perform CRUD functions using the HTML5 local storage API.

The project also includes the use of JSON.parse and JSON.stringify functions to parse data.

In addition, the HTML5 Boilerplate version 8 was used as the skeleton pages.
